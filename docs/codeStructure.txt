Code structure for moving overset grid:

1. The matrixes are solved using Eigen, stored in matrixSolver. However, we do not want to call 
matrixSolver in directly in the cuda kernel, because cuda and Eigen do not compact well. So we 
first copy the solved matrixes in matrixSolver to solver, then copy datas from cpu to gpu, and use 
them in the kernel. 

2. All matrixes except rotation matrix are stored in solver, which is stored in fluid. 

3. One solver corresponds to one fluid, they are all stored in pointer lists.

4. Coarse-Fine interpolate: Perform a stream operation to all the datas, the points which have 
some non-streamed directions (the boundary cannot be streamed) will be interpolated. 

5. Fine-Coarse interpolate: Perform a stream operation to all the datas, the points which have 
some non-streamed directions will be interpolated. Need "status_invalid".

6. In coarse->fine interpolation, we need to perform "fa,r = fa - (fa(eq) - fr(eq))". fa,r means
the relative f from static coordinate, to obtain it, we need to subtract fa (f from static 
coordinate) by fa(eq) and fr(eq).

7. Remined that the code will break if v > 2.6, and is stable below that range.
